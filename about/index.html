OpenRuns is an app for basketball players that allows you to connect with hoopers from all over the world, organize pickup games tailored to your exact location and skill level, and let's you know where every run is happening in any city around the world! Perfect for the park, campus rec center, or local gym, OpenRuns is the platform that every basketball player - from rec league hooper to NBA all star - has been in need of for years!</p><div class=row><div class=col-sm-7><h4>The Vision</h4><p>Every summer dozens of college and NBA superstars descend upon the campus of the University of California-Los Angeles for the famous afternoon open runs at UCLA's Student Activities Center. On any given afternoon you can expect to see the gym packed with the likes of NBA players, such as Kevin Durant or Steven Nash, current and former UCLA players like Russell Westbrook, and, of course, college kids either still trying to relive their high school glory days or just playing for the love of the game. While every player there comes from a different basketball background, possesses varying skill levels, or comes from different parts of Los Angeles for that matter, they all share something in common: they're all trying to find a place to play and competition to play against. I mean, what else?</p><p>Located in one of hooping's hotbed, yet fed up with text messages, emails, and Facebook groups as the primary means of finding and organizing games, OpenRuns founder and current Pepperdine student, Christian Hanish, identified a need and saw the potential for an opportunity. A lifelong basketball player and rising entrepreneur on LA's startup scene, Hanish jumped on the opportunity to combine two passions: basketball & entrepreneurship.</p></div><div class=col-sm-5><img src=/images/founder.jpeg class="img-responsive"><p class=small>Christian Hanish, Founder & CEO of OpenRuns</p></div></div></div><div id=footer><div class=container><p class="text-muted credit">For information regarding advertising, partnerships, or other business ventures, please email <a href=mailto:christian@openrunsapp.com>christian@openrunsapp.com</a></p></div></div></body></html>
